## My Reads

This project is part of the Front-end Web Developer Nanodegree Program from Udacity. 
The goal of the project was building a two page responsive app using React.js.

The app allows you to create an online library with your books. There's a search page to look for books about different topics. There's a main page where you can put the books on three different shelves (currently reading, want to read and read). 
Once a book is on a shelf, if it appears in the search results, it will be seen that it's already on a shelf.

### How to run the app
- Copy or fork the repository
- Open the repository in your terminal and run npm-install and npm-start

You can see a demo of the app at this address: https://my-library.netlify.com/
